# Baboolya
Hi there! It's a simple bot written on Ruby and based on [discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb) gem.

You can use this as example of gem's usage or use it as your own bot by changing cfg file and something in code. Based on AppleJuicetice bot.
Feel free to ask me, I will try to help you.

Additional gem that can be required - HTTParty (`gem install httparty`)

See ya
